	First of all , after opening the html file you'll have a welcome screen which needs yor name as an input.

	After that the game will start , the game consists of four levels.






						Game explanation :

The main goal of the traditional game is to get the boxes in the holes postions in any order to get through the next level .

The rock moves when there is no block or boxes in front of it .

The rock can move the box when no blocks or even another box in their way .

Here we have the same concept but for every box there is only one suitable hole .

To know the suitable hole we hover any box , there is a box in the top right which will show the box information or description .

For example : in the first level the boxes has these info :"DD","DB","DW"..... ,the holes have these info : "1 Byte","2Bytes"....

We then need to put the "DD" box in the "2 Bytes" hole .

When you put the box in the right hole its background color will change into dark blue.

If you move it again into any wrong position the background returns yellow.

You can reset the level by clicking on "Reset current level" button.(time will not be reset to avoid cheating)

You'll win the level when all boxes are in their right postions.

After every level you'll get a question on what you have learnt in this level.
